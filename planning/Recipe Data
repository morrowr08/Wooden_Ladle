1)Lasagna

prep: 30 mins
cook: 2 hours and 30mins

INGREDIENTS:

1 pound sweet Italian sausage
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

DIRECTIONS:

1.	In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
2.	Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
3.	Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4.	To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
5.	Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.

3/4 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

DIRECTIONS:

2.	Pour egg into a small shallow bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into egg, then into the bread crumbs. Place coated chicken on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.

4)Mini Cheesecakes

prep: 3 hours;
cook: 30 mins;

INGREDIENTS:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup butter, melted
12 oz cream cheese, room temperature
1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp flour
1 tsp vanilla
1 egg + 1 egg yolk
2 Tbsp milk

DIRECTIONS:
1.  Combine graham crackers and butter in a small bowl. Spoon into each cavity of the pan, and press firmly. Bake at 350 degrees for 6-8 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges.
2.  Beat cream cheese and sugar for several minutes--until completely smooth. Add flour and vanilla, stir well. Add egg and milk. Mix just until combined and smooth.
3.  Pour cheesecake mixture into pan, filling each cavity slightly more than 3/4 full. Bake at 375 degrees for 15-20 minutes, or until cakes appear matte on top and do not wiggle when the pan is moved. It will look like they're exploding a bit over the top of the pan, but they will go down while cooling.
4.  Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for 2 hours.
Remove from pan and enjoy! Serves 12.



5)Omlette

prep: 20 mins
cook: 10 mins

INGREDIENTS:
4 Fresh To Market eggs
1 tablespoon butter
¼ red bell pepper, diced small
1 green onion, sliced fine on a bias
½ hot link sausage, diced small
2 slices bacon, diced small
½ cup Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
Pinch of kosher or sea salt

DIRECTIONS
1.  Cook bacon and hot link in a non-stick omelette pan over medium heat, then remove.  Add the veggies, cook them a little bit using the bacon grease, then remove.
2.  Whisk the eggs in a bowl, add the butter to the same pan after wiping it clean with a paper towel, and make sure the pan is not still too hot from cooking your meat and veggies. You want the heat to be medium on your burner or range. After the butter has melted, make sure it covers the entire bottom of the pan, then add your eggs.
3.  With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, starting from the outer edge scrape the egg towards the middle of the pan – this removes cooked egg from the bottom and makes way for some raw egg to cook; do this several times until the raw egg is about 90% cooked and you have about an eighth of an inch of raw egg on top.
4.  Now for the flip: make sure that the eggs have not stuck by giving them a little jiggle; if part of the eggs is not moving, youll know they have stuck. In one motion, front to back (not up and down), slide the eggs forward so that they flop over and move the pan back under the flopping eggs. If you are not familiar with this technique, you can practice it with a piece of bread in the same clean pan. The key is to move the pan up and down as little as possible.
5.  After the omelette has been flipped over, add your grated cheese, the meat and vegetables, and a pinch of salt.
6.  Now for the slide: again, making sure the eggs have not stuck, slide the omelette halfway out of the pan onto the plate and tilt the rest of the omelette, flopping happily onto itself. A browned omelette is classically incorrect; an omelette should be cooked through, but the eggs should not be browned.



6)French Toast

prep:10 mins
cook:20 mins

INGREDIENTS
4 large eggs
1/2 cup (120 ml) milk
1/4 cup (60 ml) heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pinch of salt
8 slices day-old bread (3/4-inch-thick)
3 tablespoons butter, plus more for serving
Optional toppings: Powdered sugar, maple syrup, berries, whipped cream, cinnamon sugar (recipe below)

DIRECTIONS:
1.  Heat oven to 200 degrees F (93C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Slide baking sheet into oven. (It is best to make French toast in batches, so this is to keep cooked batches warm while the rest are cooked).
Prepare French Toast
2.  Whisk eggs, milk, cream, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt together until well blended.
Line bread slices up in a large baking dish (it is okay if they overlap). Pour egg mixture over bread slices then move and flip the bread around so each slice is completely moistened with the egg mixture. Continue to move the slices around in the egg mixture until the bread has soaked it all up.
3.  Melt a tablespoon of butter in a heavy, large pan or griddle over medium-low heat. Working in batches, transfer a few slices of the soaked bread to the pan and cook until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
4.  Transfer cooked French toast to warm oven while you cook the remaining bread slices. Add additional butter as needed for each batch.
